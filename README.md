# Auto-Text-Summarizer

The project uses a Naive Bayes approach to classify sentence as summary sentence or not.
The data set being used is of Australian legal cases taken from the UCI repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Legal+Case+Reports)

We chose to extract certain features from a sentence in order to represent it in a vector/representable space.

The features we chose were:
1. Number of nouns (Surely a sentence with more nouns is more important)
2. Sentence length (A longer sentence may be more important)

During the whole process, we learned a lot.
We developed some non Naive Bayes codes as well: NeuralNet.py and TextRank.py

If you need help, feel free to ask/make an issue.
